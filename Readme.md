# üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the LinkedIn Job Scraper and Alerter:

- Install Dependencies

First, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required packages:

```bash
npm i
```

- Configure Your Job Search

Open [main.js](./main.js) and customize the `queryOptions` object with your desired job search criteria. Uncomment and adjust the options as needed.

```javascript
const queryOptions = {
    keyword: 'Frontend', // e.g., 'Software Engineer', 'Data Scientist'
    location: 'Bengaluru', // e.g., 'New York City', 'Remote'
    dateSincePosted: '5m', // Options: '5m', '10m', '1hr', '24hr' (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours)
    // jobType: 'full time', // Options: 'full time', 'part time', 'contract', 'temporary', 'volunteer', 'internship'
    // remoteFilter: 'remote', // Uncomment for remote jobs
    // salary: 120000, // Minimum Salary: 40000, 60000, 80000, 100000, 120000
    // experienceLevel: "entry level", // Options: 'internship', 'entry level', 'associate', 'senior', 'director', 'executive'
    // sortBy: "recent", // Options: 'recent', 'relevant'
    limit: '10', // Number of jobs to scrape per run
    page: "0", // Starting page for results
};
```

- Add `NotificationAPI` Credentials

In the same file, replace <credentials> with your actual `NotificationAPI` client ID and client secret. You can find these in your `NotificationAPI` dashboard after signing up.

```javascript
notificationapi.init(
    '<YOUR_NOTIFICATIONAPI_CLIENT_ID>',
    '<YOUR_NOTIFICATIONAPI_CLIENT_SECRET>'
)
```

- Run the Application

Once configured, start the scraper:

```shell
npm start
```

The application will begin scraping jobs and sending email alerts based on your settings.
